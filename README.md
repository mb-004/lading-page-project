# Landing Page

## Description

The Landing Page is a final course Project from Udacity, with the aim of working with Javascript and DOM Manipulation mainly.
The `sections` of the page are supposed to be billed dinamically, in a way that if the user needs to add more `sections` to the HTML file, the navigation bar will also be updated dinamically to match.
There are also other interesting features involved such as highlighted `sections` in the viewport with smooth scrolling and a newsletter `form`.

## Installation

You should be able to see the final result by opening the **index.html** file.

In case you might want to have access to the code, and modify it in your own directory, you can follow Github instructions on how to clone the repository using the command line or simply download the files.

## License

The starter code is licensed by Udacity, but I added some changes on my own to complete the project, so you're free to use this as well.
